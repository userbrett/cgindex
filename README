README
====================

This project provides a customizable replacement for the standard directory
listing that Apache webserver provides.

When looking for other options beyond "Fancy Indexing" from Apache, I found:

1.  Support for CSS in LIGHTTPD via "mod_dirlisting"
2.  Several ways using JavaScript and CSS
3.  PHP scripts that seemed to require traversal via the document root

So I set out to write my own, and discovered one familiar little option that
made the whole exercise trivial:  DirectoryIndex

Typically, the DirectoryIndex variable looks something like this:
DirectoryIndex          index.html index.shtml index.htm

However, it can also look like this:
DirectoryIndex          index.html index.shtml index.htm /cgi-bin/index.cgi

Which means, all you have to do is write a CGI script, put it into the
/cgi-bin directory, and any directory listing that doesn't have a appropriate
file will get the local /cgi-bin/index.cgi script INSTEAD OF the Apache
Directory Index.

In making the script, a custom header and footer were also created.  The
header and footer are both sourced and printed by the script.

What about photos?

The next goal was, for directories containing a list of photos, to display a
thumbnail of the actual photo next to the link to the file.  To accomplish
this, 1) the "convert" program from ImageMagick was used to create the
thumbnail, and 2) the script "createthumbs.pl" was written to recursively
create a thumbnail for each photo in a directory tree.

Integration of the thumbnails into the directory listing was done by having
/cgi-bin/index.cgi check if the file to be listed has an associated
thumbnail, and if so, display it alongside the link to the actual image.
