To install and configure:

1) Copy the CGI scripts (index.cgi && showfile.cgi) to your
   ScriptAlias directory.

2) Update Apache's DirectoryIndex parameter, by appending
   /cgi-bin/index.cgi to that parameter.

3) Download the "index_icons" from http://autoindex.sourceforge.net/
   and map them in httpd.conf to /index_icons:

     Alias /index_icons "/var/www/index_icons"
     <Directory "/var/www/index_icons">
         Options Indexes MultiViews
     </Directory>

4) Configure any alias Document Roots in the hash %alias_doc_roots, in both
   index.cgi and showfile.cgi.

   The document roots parameter maps directory trees that are not mounted
   in the actual path of the webserver.  Say, for example, you have the
   DocumentRoot to be /var/www/html/domain.com, and have some NFS shares
   that are elsewhere - like:

     /mnt/pub
     /mnt/docs

   While the files systems under /mnt may be mapped into Apache using
   something like:

      Alias /pub  /mnt/pub
      Alias /docs /mnt/docs

   For CGIndex to work, you would make the same mapping in %alias_doc_roots
   in both index.cgi and showfile.cgi.

5) Modify the HTML print statements to suit your needs.

6) Optional (but recommended): Create a cgi.header and cgi.footer to be
   displayed above and below the output from index.cgi.  Both should be
   placed in DOCUMENT_ROOT.  Examples may be found in the html directory.
   Also, create a main.html for the body of the initial page.
